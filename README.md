Steps:

1. Run the python notebook file once and a log file will be created
2. Then in the command prompt paste this line of code: tensorboard --logdir="Your Path\log" (Don't forget to put your path)
3. After running you will get a port link, paste it into your browser and you will get a sweet little graph depicting accuracy, adam loss, and losses.

You will need the following libraries to be installed:

1. Tensorboard
2. tensorflow
3. tflearn
4. tqdm
